# Changelog

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-08

### Changed

- **API Documentation (TSDoc)**: Added comprehensive TSDoc comments to all
  exported classes, methods, and types in the `packages/core` source code. This
  improves developer experience by providing better autocompletion and inline
  documentation in code editors.

This is the first major release of the `@ddgll/ts-crdt` library after a
significant refactoring and stabilization effort. The library is now a robust,
event-driven CRDT implementation suitable for building real-time collaborative
applications.
